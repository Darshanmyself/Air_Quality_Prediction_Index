**Air Quality Prediction Index**

This machine learning project is focused on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) over time using a time-series forecasting model, Facebook Prophet. AQI is a crucial measure that determines the quality of air and helps in understanding pollution levels. This project uses historical air quality data to predict future values, aiding in pollution control and environmental safety efforts.

**Project Overview**

**Problem Statement:**
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the Air Quality Index based on historical air quality data. Time-series data is analyzed and processed to generate accurate future predictions of AQI, which is essential for health and environmental planning.

**Solution:**
The FB Prophet model, an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook, is used to build a time-series forecasting model. It is well-suited for data with clear trends and seasonality.
Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis help to understand the data patterns, which feed into the prediction model.

**Stages of the Project:**

**1. Data Collection and Loading:**
The historical air quality data is loaded into the project. The dataset includes features like date and the corresponding AQI levels.
The data is cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, or anomalies.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
The data is analyzed to understand the trends, seasonality, and overall patterns.
Visualizations (like line plots) are used to observe how AQI values fluctuate over time.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**
Date Parsing: The date column is converted to a suitable format for time-series analysis.
Handling Missing Values: Strategies are implemented to either fill or drop missing data points to ensure smooth modeling.

**4. FB Prophet Model Implementation:**
The Facebook Prophet model is designed for time-series forecasting that accounts for seasonality, trends, and holidays.
Model Fitting: The historical AQI data is used to fit the Prophet model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Various parameters such as seasonality_mode and interval_width are tuned to improve the model’s performance.

**5. Forecasting and Evaluation:**
The trained model is used to predict future AQI values.
The results are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of predictions.
Forecasting is visualized to compare predicted and actual AQI values over time.

**6. Visualization of Results:**
Predicted AQI values are plotted alongside actual values to visually assess the model’s accuracy.
Future AQI values are forecasted and plotted, providing a clear view of upcoming trends in air quality.

**Technologies and Tools Used**

**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries:**
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
FB Prophet: The core time-series forecasting model used in this project.
Google Colab: For running the code and documenting the workflow.

**Key Features of FB Prophet:**
**Automatic Seasonality Detection**: Prophet automatically detects daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality in the data.
**Robust to Missing Data**: The model can handle missing data points in time-series.
**Customizable Forecasts**: The model allows for fine-tuning of holidays, seasonality, and change points.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how time-series forecasting can be applied to air quality data using the FB Prophet model. The project provides insights into the future AQI trends, helping authorities take preventive actions in high pollution periods.
